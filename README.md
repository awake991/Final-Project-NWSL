# Final Project
 In my final project, I decided to focus on the NWSL and see if there was a "sophmore slum" after players had their rookie year. Based on the data I analyzed, this was not a common theme; most players improved. Only in the goalkeepers did you see more of a sophomore slump, either due to them leaving the league or losing the starting spot, which is much more common in that position.
